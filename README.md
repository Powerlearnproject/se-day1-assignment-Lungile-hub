#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software enginneering is the process of designing, developing, testing, and maintaining software applications. Software is important to the technology industry as it provides a structured approach to developing reliable, efficient, and scalable software systems, which are the foundation of modern technology, driving innovation, enabling new products and services, and improving user experiences across various sectors like healthcare, finance, and communication, ultimately impacting how we live and work today; essentially, it ensures quality and consistency in software development while adapting to evolving technological needs.  

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Introduction to Software Engineering
The term "software engineering" was first introduced at the NATO Software Engineering Conference in 1968. This marked a shift in thinking about software development as an engineering discipline rather than just programming, emphasizing structured methodologies and best practices to manage complexity.

Development of Structured Programming 
The rise of structured programming, promoted by Edsger Dijkstra and others, emphasized breaking down code into smaller, manageable modules with clear control structures. This improved code readability, maintainability, and reduced errors compared to earlier unstructured programming techniques.

The Agile Manifesto 
The publication of the Agile Manifesto introduced a flexible, iterative approach to software development, prioritizing customer collaboration, adaptability, and continuous delivery over rigid, document-heavy processes. This revolutionized how teams build software, leading to widespread adoption of Agile methodologies like Scrum and Kanban.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
1.Planning - This phase involves defining the project scope, objectives and feasibility. It includes budget and resource allocation.
2. Requirement Analysis- Gathering detailed user needs and translating them into functional specifications.
3. Design - The software architecture, usre interfaces and system components are designed based on gathered requirements.
4. Implement(Coding) - Developers write the actual code based on the design specifications following best coding practices.
5. Testing -  Executing tests to identify and fix bugs, ensuring the software meets functional and non-functional requirements. 
6. Deployment - The tested software is deployed to the production environment for end-users, ensuring smooth installation and configuration.
7. Maintanance - Addressing issues reported after deployment, including bug fixes, updates, and enhancements. 

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
1.Approach
Waterfall Methodoligies follows a linear and sequential approach, where each phase must be completed before moving to the next. Adile Methodoligies is iterative and incremental with development occuring in small, manageable cycles.
2. Flexibility
Waterfall is rigid; changes to requirements are difficult once the process starts. Agile is highly flexible, allowing changes even late in development based on feedback.
3. Customer Involvement
In Waterfall, customer involvement is minimal after the initial requirement gathering. Agile emphasizes continuous collaboration with customers throughout development.
4.Delivery
Waterfall dilivers the entire product at the end, while Agile releases functional incremants in short cycles.
5. Testing
Testing in Waterfall is done only after development is complete, which can lead to discovering major issues late. In Agile, testing is continuous, allowing early detection and fixing of issues.
